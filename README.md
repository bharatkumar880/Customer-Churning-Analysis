Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Sector

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry, directly impacting profitability and customer lifetime value. This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer behavior to uncover key churn drivers, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights—all using data analysis techniques without any machine learning.

Problem Statement

Telecom companies face high competition and often struggle to retain customers. A significant number of users discontinue their services due to various reasons like poor service quality, high billing, or short-term contracts. Without knowing what causes churn, it's difficult to take proactive action.

Solution

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer churn data to:

Compare churned vs. retained customer segments

Identify key features contributing to churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure)

Visualize trends using graphs like bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and pie charts

Provide meaningful insights to support business decision-making

All analysis is done using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook.

Impact

The insights gained from this analysis can help telecom providers:

Understand which customer groups are at higher churn risk

Improve customer retention through contract adjustments or service enhancements

Focus on high-value customers likely to churn

Make data-driven strategic decisions


Ultimately, this project supports telecom companies in reducing churn, increasing customer satisfaction, and maximizing long-term revenue.
